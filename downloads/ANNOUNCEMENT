Portable Computing Language (PoCL) v3.0 released
------------------------------------------------

PoCL is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the
OpenCL standard. It likely supports the minimal v3.0 feature set (official
conformance stamp not yet applied for).

In addition to being an easily portable multi-device (truly
heterogeneous) open-source OpenCL implementation, a major goal of this
project is improving interoperability for diversity of OpenCL-capable
devices by integrating them to a single centrally orchestrated platform.
Another key goal is to enhance performance portability of OpenCL
programs across device types utilizing runtime and compiler techniques.

Upstream PoCL currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda
and ASIPs (experimental, see: http://openasip.org). It is also known to
have multiple (private) adaptations in active production use.

Release Highlights
------------------

* Minimal OpenCL 3.0 feature set _should_ be now supported (official
  conformance stamp still to apply for).
* Support for Clang/LLVM 14.0.
* Improved tracing and visualization.
* Support for generating specialized work-group functions and include them
  in the PoCL kernel program binaries.
* Fixed printf for SPIR-V.
* A lot of other fixes and improvements.

Misc. Notes
-----------

* Please note that there's an official PoCL "maintenance policy" in
place. This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite
project that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future PoCL
releases: http://portablecl.org/docs/html/maintainer-policy.html

* We are still looking for ARM CPU and RISC-V CPU maintainers (and
any other target of your interest). If you are interested in ensuring
PoCL stays stable for these processor architectures in the future,
please contact us.
