.. _pocl-conformance:

=======================
OpenCL conformance
=======================

Conformance related CMake options
---------------------------------

- ``-DENABLE_CONFORMANCE=ON/OFF``
  Defaults to OFF. This option by itself does not guarantee OpenCL-conformant build;
  it merely ensures that a build fails if some CMake options which are known to result
  in non-conformant PoCL build are given. Only applies to CPU driver.

  Changes when ENABLE_CONFORMANCE is ON, the CPU drivers are built
  with the following changes:

    * read-write images are disabled (some 1D/2D image array tests fail)
    * the list of supported image formats is much smaller
    * SLEEF is always enforced for the builtin library
    * cl_khr_fp16 is disabled
    * cl_khr_subgroup_{ballot,shuffle} are disabled
    * cl_intel_subgroups,cl_intel_required_subgroup_size are disabled

  If ENABLE_CONFORMANCE is OFF, and ENABLE_HOST_CPU_DEVICES is ON,
  the conformance testsuite is disabled in CMake. This is because
  some CTS tests will fail on such build.

Supported & Unsupported optional OpenCL 3.0 features
------------------------------------------------------

This list is only related to CPU devices (cpu & cpu-minimal drivers).
Other drivers (CUDA, TCE etc) only support OpenCL 1.2.
Note that 3.0 support on CPU devices requires LLVM 14 or newer.

Supported 3.0 features:

  * Shared Virtual Memory
  * C11 atomics
  * 3D Image Writes
  * SPIR-V
  * Program Scope Global Variables
  * Subgroups
  * Generic Address Space

Unsupported 3.0 features:

  * Device-side enqueue
  * Pipes
  * Non-Uniform Work Groups
  * Read-Write Images
  * Creating 2D Images from Buffers
  * sRGB & Depth Images
  * Device and Host Timer Synchronization
  * Intermediate Language Programs
  * Program Initialization and Clean-Up Kernels
  * Work Group Collective Functions

.. _running-cts:

How to run the OpenCL 3.0 conformance test suite
------------------------------------------------

You'll need to build PoCL with enabled ICD, and the ICD must be one that supports
OpenCL version 3.0 (for ocl-icd, this is available since version 2.3.0).
This is because while the CTS will run with 1.2 devices, it requires 3.0 headers
and 3.0 ICD to build. You'll also need to enable the suite in the pocl's external test suite set.
This is done by adding ``-DENABLE_TESTSUITES=conformance -DENABLE_CONFORMANCE=ON``
to the cmake command line. After this ``make prepare_examples`` fetches and
prepares the conformance suite for testing. After building pocl with ``make``,
the CTS can be run with ``ctest -L <LABEL>`` where ``<LABEL>`` is a CTest label.

There are three different CTest labels for using CTS, one label covers the full
set tests in CTS, the other two contain a smaller subset of CTS tests. The fastest
is ``conformance_suite_micro_main`` label, which takes approx 10-30 minutes on
current (desktop) hardware. The medium sized ``conformance_suite_mini_main``
can take 1-2 hours on current hardware. The full sized CTS is available
with label ``conformance_suite_full_main``. This can take 10-30 hrs on current
hardware.

If PoCL is compiled with SPIR-V support, three more labels are available, where
``_main`` suffix is replaced by ``_spirv`` (e.g. ``conformance_suite_mini_spirv``)
These labels will run the same tests as the _main variant, but use offline
compilation to produce SPIR-V and use that to create programs,
instead of default creating from OpenCL C source.

Note that running ``ctest -L conformance_suite_micro`` will run *both* variants
(the online and offline compilation) since the -L option takes a regexp.

Additionally, there is a new cmake label, ``conformance_30_only``
to run tests which are only relevant to OpenCL 3.0.

CPU device version 1.2 should also work with CTS 3.0 (tests will be skipped).

.. _known-issues:

Known issues related to CTS
---------------------------

- a few tests from ``basic/test_basic`` may fail / segfault because they
  request a huge amount of memory for buffers.

- some tests from ``relationals/test_relationals`` can fail with specific
  LLVM versions, this is an LLVM bug, fixed in LLVM 13.

- a few tests may run much faster if you limit the reported Global memory size
  with POCL_MEMORY_LIMIT env var. In particular, "kernel_image_methods" test
  with "max_images" argument.

- With LLVM 15 and 16, when running CTS with the offline compilation mode
  (= via SPIR-V), Clang + SPIR-V translator produce invalid
  SPIR-V for several tests. PoCL bugreport:
  `<https://github.com/pocl/pocl/issues/1232>`_
  Related Khronos issues:
  `<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/issues/2008>`_
  `<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/issues/2024>`_
  `<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator/issues/2025>`_

- Integer division by zero. OpenCL 1.2 specification requires that division by
  zero on integers results in undefined values, instead of raising exceptions.
  This requires pocl to install a handler of SIGFPE. The handler is per-process,
  but it checks the thread ID, so that it only ignores the error for the CPU
  driver threads, not the user program's threads. This might not work on every
  system. The handler can be disabled completely by setting the env variable
  POCL_SIGFPE_HANDLER to 0.
  Note that this is currently only relevant for x86(-64) + Linux, on all other
  systems this issue is not handled in any way (thus Pocl is likely
  non-conformant there).

- Many of ``native_`` and ``half_`` variants of kernel library functions are mapped
  to the "full" variants.

- clSetUserEventStatus() called with negative status. The Spec leaves the behaviour
  in this case as "implementation defined", and this part of pocl is
  only very lightly tested by the conformance tests. clSetUserEventStatus()
  called with CL_COMPLETE works as expected, and is heavily used by
  the conversions conformance test.

Conformance tests results (precision of builtin math library functions)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that it's impossible to test double precision on the entire range,
therefore the results may vary.
